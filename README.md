# Patryk Wisniewski's CV 

## Overview

This repository contains my Curriculum Vitae (CV) in multiple languages. This CV is written in LaTeX, a high-quality typesetting system; formatted with and without a picture. 


## Contents
The CVs are available in the root directory of this repository
-   `CV_'Language'.tex` - Those versions include a photograph in the specified language
-   `CV_'Language'_NoPic.tex` - Those versions omit the photograph for a more traditional layout.

To avoid redundancy most of the CV contents in each language are available in the `content/` directory. The photograph is also included in this directory.
